# pyCobalt GUI (WIP)

_Save what you love_

### A fast and simple graphical application for downloading videos from the internet based on Python utilising [cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/)'s API without any bullshit

Just paste your video link from a [supported](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt#supported-services) service, press download and presto! Your file is here!
The program supports multiple audio formats and video codecs and lets you save just the audio too.

It is still in the early stages and far from the finished product so there may be some issues and missing features that will get polished in the future. 

If you need any help or assistance or if there is a problem with the code, please contact somecutedoragons on Discord (annoy me, not wukko unless it's a problem on cobalt's side)
